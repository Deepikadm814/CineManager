# TheatreManagement
The system is built to serve as an onsite booking and management system for a theatre (franchise). Two actors are considered, one being the cashier at the booking kiosk, who books tickets in exchange for payment, and the other being the manager who views statistics, alters pricing structures, schedules showings of movies, and adds new movies that are to be premiered.
